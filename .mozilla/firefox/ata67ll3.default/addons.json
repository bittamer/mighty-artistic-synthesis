I was forced to re-write 10 years of mature FoxyProxy code from scratch. There are many missing features, and in almost all cases that is due to Firefox 57+ limitations or bugs (for example, custom-colored toolbar icons). The UI also had to change; I could no longer make FoxyProxy look like a native application. It now looks more like a traditional web site.\n\nI understand your frustration. Please refrain from attacking me because there is nothing I can do to change Mozilla's decisions. Thank you for using my labor of love.\n-- Eric H.

The \"Download history\" permission is required only because Firefox does not allow add-ons to specify just \"download files\" without \"download history\". It's all or nothing. Internally, nothing is done with your download history. This is open source software and you can view the code yourself at https://code.getfoxyproxy.org\n\nWHAT IS IT?\nFoxyProxy is a Firefox extension which automatically switches an internet connection across one or more proxy servers based on URL patterns. Put simply, FoxyProxy automates the manual process of editing Firefox's Connection Settings dialog. Proxy server switching occurs based on the loading URL and the switching rules you define.\n\n    Switch proxies with URL pattern matching\n    Custom colors make it easy to see which proxy is in use\n    Advanced logging shows you which proxies were used and when\n    Automatically synchronize all of your proxy settings with your other Firefox instances when you use Firefox Sync.

Cookies are separated by container, allowing you to use the web with multiple identities or accounts simultaneously.","fullDescription":"About This Extension\n\nThe Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension lets you carve out a separate box for each of your online lives – no more opening a different browser just to check your work email! Here is a quick video showing you how it works.\n\nUnder the hood, it separates website storage into tab-specific Containers. Cookies downloaded by one Container are not available to other Containers. With the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension, you can...\n\n    Sign in to two different accounts on the same site (for example, you could sign in to work email and home email in two different Container tabs.\n    Keep different kinds of browsing far away from each other (for example, you might use one Container tab for managing your Checking Account and a different Container tab for searching for new songs by your favorite band)\n    Avoid leaving social-network footprints all over the web (for example, you could use a Container tab for signing in to a social network, and use a different tab for visiting online news sites, keeping your social identity separate from tracking scripts on news sites)\n\n\nAfter installing the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension, click the Containers icon to edit your Containers. Change their colors, names, and icons. Long-click the new tab button to open a new Container tab.\n\nPrivacy in Firefox Multi-Account Containers\n\nThe Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension does not send any information to Mozilla.\n\nHow does this compare to the Facebook Container extension?\nFacebook Container specifically isolates Facebook and works automatically. The Firefox Multi-Account Containers is a more general extension that allows you to create containers and determine which sites open in each container. This extension can be customized to suit your needs for multiple sites and multiple logins, but takes more time to set up than Facebook Container.\n\nYou can use Multi-Account Containers to create a container for Facebook and assign facebook.com to it. Multi-Account Containers will then make sure to only open facebook.com in the Facebook Container. However, unlike Facebook Container, Multi-Account Containers doesn’t prevent you from opening non-Facebook sites in your Facebook Container. So users of Multi-Account Containers need to take a bit extra care to make sure they leave the Facebook Container when navigating to other sites. In addition, Facebook Container assigns some Facebook-owned sites like Instagram and Messenger to the Facebook Container. With Multi-Account Containers, you will have to assign these in addition to facebook.com.\n\nFacebook Container also deletes Facebook cookies from your other containers on install and when you restart the browser, to clean up any potential Facebook trackers. Multi-Account Containers does not do that for you.\n\nCan I use both Multi-Account Containers and Facebook Container?\nYes, but you need to be a little careful. Don't use Multi-Account Container to assign facebook.com to a Container, and then try installing Facebook Container. If you a Multi-Account Containers user and want to use both addons, unassign facebook.com, messenger.com, and instagram.com first, then install Facebook Container.\n\nHaven't I seen this in Firefox before?\n\nFirefox Multi-Account Containers was first introduced as \"Containers\" available only in Firefox Nightly. It went on to be a Test Pilot Experiment, where we improved the user experience and added new features. Now it exists here as an extension that can be installed by all Firefox users.\n\nAlthough you can still use the feature built into Firefox Nightly, we recommend using this extension as it has a richer user experience.\n\nKeyboard shortcuts\n\nCtrl + . (period) keyboard shortcut is available to open the containers panel. You can then use tab and the enter keys to open new container tabs.","weeklyDownloads":7825,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Mozilla","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/mozilla/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/196/196940.png?modified=1517496900","width":700,"height":386,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/196/196940.png?modified=1517496900","thumbnailWidth":200,"thumbnailHeight":110,"caption":"Containers let you separate the different parts of your online life."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/196/196941.png?modified=1517496900","width":700,"height":386,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/196/196941.png?modified=1517496900","thumbnailWidth":200,"thumbnailHeight":110,"caption":"Select from categories like Shopping, Finance, and Work or create custom labels that work for you."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/196/196942.png?modified=1517496900","width":700,"height":386,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/196/196942.png?modified=1517496900","thumbnailWidth":200,"thumbnailHeight":110,"caption":"Use color-coded labels to see different Containers at a glance."}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.4412,"reviewCount":1052,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/reviews/","updateDate":1519332612000},{"id":"langpack-en-GB@firefox.mozilla.org","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/static/img/addon-icons/default-32.png","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/static/img/addon-icons/default-64.png"},"name":"English (GB) Language Pack","version":"60.0buildid20180516032328","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/957376/english_gb_language_pack-60.0buildid20180516032328-an+fx.xpi?src=","size":490905,"homepageURL":null,"supportURL":null,"description":"English (GB) Language Pack","fullDescription":null,"weeklyDownloads":5494,"type":"locale","creator":{"name":"Mozilla","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/mozilla/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[],"contributionURL":null,"averageRating":2.6901,"reviewCount":97,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/english-gb-language-pack/reviews/","updateDate":1526908392000},{"id":"jid1-ZAdIEUB7XOzOJw@jetpack","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/385/385621-32.png?modified=1526591956","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/385/385621-64.png?modified=1526591956"},"name":"DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials","version":"2018.5.1","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/944736/duckduckgo_privacy_essentials-2018.5.1-an+fx.xpi?src=","size":661758,"homepageURL":"https://duckduckgo.com/app","supportURL":null,"description":"Privacy, simplified.
